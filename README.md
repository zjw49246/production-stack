# LLMStack: reference stack for production vLLM deployment 


**LLMStack** project provides a reference implementation on how to build an inference stack on top of vLLM, which allows you to:

- 🚀 Scale from single vLLM instance to distributed vLLM deployment without changing any application code
- 💻 Monitor the  through a web dashboard
- 😄 Enjoy the performance benefits brought by request routing and KV cache offloading

## Latest News:

- 🔥 LLMStack is released! Checkout our [release blogs](https://blog.lmcache.ai/2025-01-22-stack-release/) [01-22-2025]

## Architecture

The stack is set up using [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/), and contains the following key parts:

- **Serving engine**: The vLLM engines that run different LLMs
- **Request router**: Directs requests to appropriate backends based on routing keys or session IDs to maximize KV cache reuse.
- **Observability stack**: monitors the metrics of the backends through [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) + [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

## Deploying LLMStack via Helm

### Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes (K8s) environment with GPUs
  - Run `cd utils && bash install-minikube-cluster.sh`
  - Or follow our [tutorial](tutorials/00-install-kubernetes-env.md)

### Deployment

LLMStack can be deployed via helm charts. Clone the repo to local and execute the following commands for a minimal deployment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack.git
cd production-stack/
sudo helm repo add llmstack-repo https://lmcache.github.io/helm/
sudo helm install llmstack llmstack-repo/vllm-stack -f tutorials/assets/values-01-minimal-example.yaml
```

The deployed stack provides the same [**OpenAI API interface**](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html?ref=blog.mozilla.ai#openai-compatible-server) as vLLM, and can be accessed through kubernetes service.

To validate the installation and and send query to the stack, refer to [this tutorial](tutorials/01-minimal-helm-installation.md).

For more information about customizing the helm chart, please refer to [values.yaml](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/blob/main/helm/values.yaml) and our other [tutorials](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/tree/main/tutorials).


### Uninstall

```bash
sudo helm uninstall llmstack
```


## Grafana Dashboard

### Features

The Grafana dashboard provides the following insights:


1. **Available vLLM Instances**: Displays the number of healthy instances.
2. **Request Latency Distribution**: Visualizes end-to-end request latency.
3. **Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) Distribution**: Monitors response times for token generation.
4. **Number of Running Requests**: Tracks the number of active requests per instance.
5. **Number of Pending Requests**: Tracks requests waiting to be processed.
6. **GPU KV Usage Percent**: Monitors GPU KV cache usage.
7. **GPU KV Cache Hit Rate**: Displays the hit rate for the GPU KV cache.

### Configuration

See the details in `observability/README.md`

## Router

### Overview

The router ensures efficient request distribution among backends. It supports:

- Routing to endpoints that run different models
- Exporting observability metrics for each serving engine instance, including QPS, time-to-first-token (TTFT), number of pending/running/finished requests, and uptime
- Automatic service discovery and fault tolerance by Kubernetes API
- Multiple different routing algorithms
  - Round-robin routing
  - Session-ID based routing
  - (WIP) prefix-aware routing
